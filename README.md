# Welcome to My Portfolio #

I've been working on a few projects in my off time. So far, two are ready for your review:

1. The arcade-quickstart README provides a Quickstart guide to the Python game arcade by Real Python.
2. The llm-researcher README provides information about an LLM research tool by AlgOps.

Let me know what you think! :)
